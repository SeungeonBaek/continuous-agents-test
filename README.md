DDPG  
TD3  

## Distributional DDPG

IDAC (gaussian policy, no alpha, no reparam)  
IDAC (gaussian policy, alpha, no reparam)  
IDAC (gaussian policy, no alpha, reparam => maybe not working)  
IDAC (gaussian policy, alpha, reparam => maybe not working)  
IDAC (implicit policy, no alpha)  
IDAC (implicit policy, alpha)  

## Stochastic policy
PPO  
SAC (...working)
